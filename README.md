# Loan Qualifer App (Fintech Challenge 2)

This is supposed to be a app that can sort through loan qualification criteria and data, in order to match potential lenders with loan applicants. This project was created as part of the UW Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 2.

## Technologies

I used the following:

Python 3.7.10
Conda
import csv
import sys
import fire
import questionary
from pathlib import Path


---

## Installation Guide

Hopefully this will run easily on any python reader. I used Visual Studio. But if you clone it I don't think there is anything specific that would keep it from running in another program..

---

## Usage

This is a command line interface program, so if it is running correctly it should prompt you for the information it needs.

## Contributors

UW Fintech Bootcamp gave me some initial code to start from. Also my Instructor Gerrit Hall, the TAs Kevin and Will, and my classmates all contributed to my ability to try this.
